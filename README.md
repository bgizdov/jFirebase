# JFirebase

I decided to tryout firebase for my personal projects & learning, having come from traditional SQL background, I am well versed with JPA/Hibernate when dealing with databases. But when I started firebase, I found it completely different but also having some similarities. After spending some time understanding its feature I started looking a framework similar to JPA for firebase. I found none, so I decided to write one for myself.
